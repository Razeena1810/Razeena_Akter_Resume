            <h2>
                I chose web development as my career because I have a creative mind and a passion for technology.
                To be able to combine the two will bring about immense power.
                I believe we are now living in a world where everything is done online, communicating, shopping,
                studying, working and so much more.
                Compared to the 15th century we now consume as much data in a single day as an average person from the
                1400s would have absorbed in an entire life time. This makes learning so much easier and faster than
                ever.
                To be able to code for apps that will increase learning opportunities and productivity as well as
                websites to showcase millions of businesses online,
                to be evolving and increasing my knowledge daily sounds like heaven on earth!</h2>
            <br>
            <h2> I have a deposition that is friendly and possess the ability to adapt to different environments. My
                passion
                and drive is evident in the performance of my tasks and management of exceptionally high workloads. I am
                goal orientated and able to set clear and realistic timelines. My commitment to my work has been
                complimented on numerous occasions.
                During my few work experiences I have developed excellent communication skills both verbal and written.
                I
                possess a high degree of efficiency and organization and have the ability to multitask and work well
                under
                pressure. I pride myself on honesty and reliability.
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h2>
                I am an extremely ambitous person and hard headed on reaching my full potential and becoming the best at
                what I do.
                I would love to some day join a fortune 500 company that will allow me to grow my skills as a web
                developer and shadow professional developers that I can learn from and become the best.
                I would also love to travel and seek more opportunities out there in the tech world.
                Overall being able to code and create more applications and websites that will improve the quality of
                life is my aim.

            </h2>
